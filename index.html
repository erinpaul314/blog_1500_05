            <time>November 11, 2022</time>

            <p> Despite spending billions of dollars on the Metaverse, Mark Zuckerberg’s virtual reality endeavor is failing. Celia Pearce, 
                an associate professor of game design at Northeastern, describes virtual worlds of the past, such as “Second Life” and 
                explains why they succeeded where Metaverse failed. One of the major reasons is the apparent lack of innovation beyond the 
                virtual worlds of the 2000s. The failure has contributed to Meta’s stock falling 70%, which was followed to the decision to
                lay off 11,0000 of their employees. However, Zuckerberg and Meta are continuing to invest in the Metaverse, committing 
                another $15 billion to its development. 

                Other factors contributing to the Metaverse’s struggles are its lack of aesthetic appeal in comparison to modern video 
                games, lack of market research into what consumers want, and its confusion regarding a target audience. However, the most 
                glaring issue is simple: The Metaverse is more an abstract concept than a product, and without a clear distinction of what 
                consumers will be getting, it’s an impossible idea to sell. Given the list of issues, it’s easy to assume the Metaverse 
                will never work. But Pearce asserts that at its core concept, it is something people want, which is evident in the 
                community built around “Second Life” 20 years ago. Given this fact, coupled with the team and resources available to 
                Zuckerberg, it’s almost shocking to see the complete failure that is the Metaverse unfold in real time, and to think of 
                the wasted potential.
